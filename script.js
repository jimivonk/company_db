/**
 
// * Create a list of employees of a company,
// with first name, last name and age 



// * programatically create a new property 
// called name which will be a combination of both



// * tell which users will be retiring in 2025 
// (if they are older then 65) Using filter
* tell if today is going to be their birthday

// -follow tutorials on date function!! 
// -format date to include only mm/dd/yyyy
// -create filter program to return list of retirees by 2025
-create function that compares mm/dd of DoB to current
-- return happy birthday message on UI


//++COULD USE HIGHER ORDER FUNCTION FOR SICK AND HOLIDAY

* tell who is on holidays and when they will 
be back
-create new array called holidayNow within employee records
-first value is true or false, 2nd is return date
-return array of holiday status and if on holiday return date
?? map, filter or for?? 

** could create object that stores all holiday dates
-iterates through holidays confirmedAnnualLeave(2 value set with start date end date)
and checks if current date is between said dates.
-automatically updates holiday status
-automatically calculates (let) remainingAnnualLeave 
subtracting from global const totalAnnual

***add code to ensure Saturdays and Sundays are not subtracted 
from leave


* tell if someone is on a sick leave
- object sickRecord within employee record
- boolean value

--additional fuctionality similar to holiday, ie expected 
return, doctorsNote, DNExpiry, total sick leave for period

-- can create rules with automatic triggers 
upon overstepping conditions



* merge all these in one function that gives 
a summary of employee's situation on the day

-easy peasy



Then we can build on this and later create a 
UI with this information as well.

Also, try to what we went through again and recreate the examples.
